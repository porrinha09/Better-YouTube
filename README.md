# Manual Installation

For normal users, installing via the installers makes the most sense. However when wanting to either develop BetterDiscord, or when the installers do not work, this option can be used. Please see our [detailed documentation](https://docs.betterdiscord.app/users/getting-started/installation#manual-installation) for a guide on how to do this.



# Addons

Installing addons--like plugins and themes--is easy. All you need to do is select and download an addon from [our website][website-link] and put it in your folder. If you want some more details, or just prefer a visual guide, take a look at our [tutorial on installing addons](https://docs.betterdiscord.app/users/guides/installing-addons) that includes a demonstration video.



# Platform Support

BetterDiscord currently only supports standard local Discord installs. This means snap packages, portable apps, and the web version are all not supported.

Examples of supported platforms:
- Windows 7 and newer
- macOS Yosemite and newer
- Ubuntu 14.04 and newer
